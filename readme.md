# Tarika Technologies Project

This project consists of two main folders:
1. `Trika_Technologies_backend` - Node.js Backend.
2. `tarika_tech_frontend` - React Frontend.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **npm** (v6+)
- Git

## Installation Process

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akashyadav24/tarika_tech_project.git
```

## Step 2: Backend Setup

Navigate to the `Trika_Technologies_backend` folder:

```bash
cd tarika_tech_project/Trika_Technologies_backend
```
###Install all the required Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Start the backend server:
```bash
node index.js
```

This will start the backend server. The server typically runs on http://localhost:5000, but this can be configured within the project.

## Step 3: Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `tarika_tech_frontend` folder:

```bash
cd ../tarika_tech_frontend
```

Install the necessary dependencies for the React frontend:
```bash
npm install
```



Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```
The React app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
